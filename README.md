# Wallet services

Go monorepo with two services:

- [gw-currency-wallet](services/gw-currency-wallet/README.md): wallet REST API with PostgreSQL.
- [gw-exchanger](services/gw-exchanger/README.md): gRPC exchange rates from a separate PostgreSQL database.

Wallet supports registration, login with JWT, and per-user USD/RUB/EUR balances.
Registration creates all three zero balances in the same database transaction as
the user. Authenticated users can read, deposit into and withdraw from their own
balances. Money is stored as integer minor units; the REST API uses decimal amounts.
Connecting wallet to exchanger, currency exchange, Kafka, notifications and
analytics are still planned.

go.work                      Local workspace for all three Go modules

Makefile                     Commands run from the repository root
```

## Setup and Docker

Run commands from the repository root. Docker workflows require Docker Compose;
local development also requires Make and a Go toolchain compatible with `go.work`.
Both Dockerfiles use `golang:1.27.1-bookworm`, matching the workspace and exchanger/contracts minimum version.
On first setup, create the configuration (keep an existing `config.env`):

```bash
cp example_config.env config.env
# Set your own JWT_SECRET_KEY in config.env before starting (see below).
make docker-rebuild
docker compose --env-file config.env ps -a
docker compose --env-file config.env logs wallet exchanger
```

Set `JWT_SECRET_KEY` to your own random secret of at least 32 bytes; for example,
use the output of `openssl rand -hex 32`. The example key is a placeholder.
`JWT_TTL` is a positive integer number of hours (default example: `24`).
Keep the secret in the ignored `config.env`. Wallet startup rejects invalid settings.
See the [wallet API instructions](services/gw-currency-wallet/README.md#authentication)
to register, log in and call protected endpoints.

Each application starts after its database is healthy and its migration job succeeds.
Settings in `example_config.env` use these addresses:

| Component | From your computer | Inside Compose |
|---|---|---|
| Wallet REST API | `http://localhost:8080` | `wallet:8080` |
| Exchanger gRPC | `localhost:50051` | `exchanger:50051` |
| Wallet PostgreSQL | `localhost:5432` | `db-currency-wallet:5432` |
| Exchanger PostgreSQL | `localhost:5431` | `db-exchanger:5432` |

`HTTP_PORT` and `GRPC_PORT` control application listeners; `HTTP_OUT_PORT` and
`GRPC_OUT_PORT` control published host ports. Both database containers listen on
5432; `POSTGRES_PORT` and `POSTGRES_PORT_EXCHANGER` select their host ports.
Compose overrides the applications' database ports to 5432.

Database files persist in `out/wallet_pg_data` and `out/exchanger_pg_data`.
Stopping Compose preserves them. PostgreSQL initialization settings apply only
to an empty data directory; editing credentials does not change an existing user.

## Make commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `make docker-start` | Start the full stack using existing images; build missing images |
| `make docker-rebuild` | Build and start both applications and their dependencies |
| `make docker-stop` | Stop and remove Compose containers and network; preserve database files |
| `make db-wallet` | Start wallet PostgreSQL and apply wallet migrations |
| `make db-exchanger` | Start exchanger PostgreSQL and apply exchanger migrations |
| `make local-run-wallet` | Run wallet locally with `-c config.env` and database host `localhost` |
| `make local-run-exchanger` | Run exchanger locally with `-c config.env` and database host `localhost` |
| `make local-run-go` | Alias for `local-run-wallet` |
| `make local-test-go` | Test both services and compile shared contracts |
| `make test-wallet` | Run wallet tests |
| `make test-exchanger` | Run exchanger tests |
| `make integration-test` | Run wallet, auth and exchanger repository tests against temporary PostgreSQL |

`docker-start` does not rebuild existing images after source changes; use
`docker-rebuild`. For one application only, use `docker compose --env-file
config.env up -d --build wallet` or the same command with `exchanger`.

## Local run and configuration

Stop the corresponding application container if it occupies the local listener port.
In separate terminals:

```bash
make db-wallet
make local-run-wallet
```

```bash
make db-exchanger
make local-run-exchanger
```

Both applications support `-c config.env`. Explicit environment variables override
file values, including empty values. Without `-c`, applications read only the
environment; Compose uses this mode through `env_file`.

The local Make targets override the database hostname, keeping the published database
port from configuration. Local listeners use `HTTP_PORT` / `GRPC_PORT`, not the
`*_OUT_PORT` settings. For example, `GRPC_PORT=50052 make local-run-exchanger`
selects a different local port.

JSON logs go to stdout; startup failures go to stderr. `LOG_LEVEL_WALLET` and
`LOG_LEVEL_EXCHANGER` accept DEBUG, INFO, WARN or ERROR and default to INFO.
See the service READMEs for request examples and details.

## Tests

```bash
make local-test-go
make integration-test
```

Without `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, repository integration tests for both services are skipped.
`make integration-test` creates a temporary PostgreSQL instance, runs those tests,
and removes its containers, network and volumes afterward. It does not use the
development databases or `config.env`.

Exchanger has domain, service, configuration, repository unit tests and gRPC tests
using an in-memory connection. Its PostgreSQL integration tests cover seeded rates,
empty results, concurrent reads, invalid stored currencies, database constraints
and migration rollback/reapplication. Each test uses its own schema.

Wallet tests cover authentication, exact decimal amounts, per-user balances,
registration rollback, concurrent deposits/withdrawals and overflow protection.

Wallet load-test targets are `load-test-add-balance`, `load-test-minus-balance`
and `load-test-get-balance`. They require Vegeta and run for 30 seconds.
Pass the login token through `TOKEN`; see the [load testing instructions](services/gw-currency-wallet/README.md#load-testing).

Migration `000003` deletes the old anonymous wallets. It does not create balances
for existing users; use a newly registered user for the current API until a backfill
migration is added. See [wallet migrations](services/gw-currency-wallet/README.md#migrations).
